# Programming Rust examples/exercises

My versions of the examples/execrcises from Programming Rust book.

## rust-hello
Basic executable with gcd implementation and test example.

## iron-gcd
The gcd example with a web interface. Fixed UX issues to have proper redirect
after POST so that browser won't complain on reload.

Added iron's params plugin to parse the previous result form URL's query
parameters after redirect.
